## General Information

This is my first real project in JavaScript. The Odin Project Foundation has been a grind to get through as an aspiring self-taught programmer. I have been on my Coding Journey since Oct 2021 and I have learned so much and excited to continue learning more!

This project was particularly challenging because of all the working components: creating the html and manipulating them with JavaScript. I know this was only a taste of the power that is JavaScript

I learned how to write custom functions and how to call those functions when I needed them. Not only learning how to manipulate html elements, I also learned how to inject css into JavaScript. Pretty cool stuff!

Areas needed

## Technologies Used

- Html
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

The game is against the computer and both players have to score 5 points to win the game. Computer choice is randomized and an Event Listener is added to the buttons for the User choice.

## Room for Improvement

Currently, the background interferes with the text of the game. I still need to find a good background or rework the css. I also want to add some kind of interactivity with the game. Like some effect when you click Rock, Paper, or Scissors. I also want to make each button a representation of the actual item.

To do:

- Research a new background for Rock Paper Scissors Game
- Add interactive features

## Contact
